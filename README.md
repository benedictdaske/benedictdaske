🔭 Mostly working on:
- **Hasso-Plattner Institute Potsdam** - B.Sc. student in computer science
- **Full-Stack Webapps** - developing a session planning tool for climbers (and most other people too)
- **Nix-based System Configuration** - creating a modular, clean and well-documented Nix config that allows starters to create a plug-and-play Nix Darwin or NixOS experience

🌱 I’m currently learning:
- **Webapp Deployment & Self-Hosting** - developing and hosting [nextsesh](https://nextsesh.date)
